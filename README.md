# SpaceX-landing-page-clone
Web Dev
This project is a clone of the SpaceX website landing page. 

Some of its features are:
1. You can open the first three pages in the header.
2. I have added the animation on the Rewatch button as it appears on the original website.
3. You can even see the downward arrow.
4. There is animation on the main content of the page.
5. You can also see underlining and color-changing effects throughout the page.
6. If you visit the first three pages that appear at the top of the page and scroll down, you can see the effect on the numbers.
